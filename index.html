        <h3> Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h3>
        <p> 
          Progressive enhancement is a web developement approach that starts with a solid foundation. Mainly focusing on clean, accessible content
          and then adding layers of visually appealing designs and advanced functionlity for that browser that can support it. Unlike graceful degradation, 
          which prioritizes modern browsers and only patches support for older ones, progressive enhancement ensures that all users—regardless of device or 
          browser—can access the core content and functionality. This method promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and long-term resilience, making it a 
          thoughtful and future-friendly way to build websites.

        <h3> Final Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
        <p> My sister's feedback:
            The website has a nice theme. The header and main nav looks really cool with the background image. He had a few issues with replacing h1 with his logo, so I helped him with that. We figured the error was that his logo image size did not match the height and width of the h1 element, that is why his logo did not fit in the h1 element. The links on his page were working well. I also liked the box-shadow he used. It made his website look more visually appealing. On his telescopes page, I realized that all the images inside articles have different heights, and it gave off a less professional look. He also had some errors while doing his telescope slide using an accessible slick. I shared with him the technique I used in my project last semester, and he was able to fix it. After all the hard work he put in, the website looked very well organized and sophisticated.
