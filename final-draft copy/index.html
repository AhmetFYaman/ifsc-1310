    <h2>Eyes on the Universe: Discovering the Cosmos with Space Telescopes</h2>
    <p>
      For decades, space telescopes have opened our eyes to the wonders of the universe, peering far beyond Earth’s
       atmosphere to reveal the hidden beauty and secrets of deep space. From searching for distant galaxies to studying
        the atmospheres of exoplanets, these incredible instruments are transforming how we see—and understand—our cosmos.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the legendary Hubble Space Telescope, which has delivered breathtaking images since 1990, to the revolutionary
       James Webb Space Telescope, now capturing the universe in unprecedented detail, each mission has expanded our view 
       of space and time. With every new launch, space telescopes push the boundaries of what we can explore—unlocking clues
       about the origins of stars, galaxies, and life itself.

        <p>
          Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has transformed our understanding of the universe. Operating in low Earth orbit, Hubble has captured stunning images of nebulae, galaxies, and star clusters. It played a critical role in determining the rate of expansion of the universe and has made over 1.5 million observations to date.

          The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in 2021, is the most advanced infrared observatory ever built. Positioned nearly 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, it studies the formation of the first galaxies and the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets, capturing light that has traveled for over 13 billion years.

          Chandra, launched in 1999, is NASA’s flagship X-ray telescope. It detects high-energy phenomena such as black holes, neutron stars, and galaxy cluster mergers. Chandra’s ultra-sharp imaging has revealed jets of particles from black holes and helped map dark matter distribution through galaxy cluster observations.

          <h2>Background</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Space telescopes are designed to operate above Earth's atmosphere, avoiding light pollution and atmospheric distortion. The concept dates back to the 1940s, but it wasn’t until the launch of Hubble in 1990 that space-based astronomy became widely successful. These instruments have allowed scientists to detect exoplanets, measure cosmic expansion, and view the universe as it appeared billions of years ago.
          Modern telescopes like Webb and Chandra operate in infrared and X-ray wavelengths, offering insights into the birth of stars and the structure of black holes—phenomena invisible to ground-based observatories.
