    <h2>The Evolution of Space Telescopes</h2>
    <p>
      Space telescopes have revolutionized our understanding of the universe by allowing astronomers to observe celestial objects without the interference of Earth's atmosphere. Since the first orbital telescope was launched in the 1960s, these remarkable instruments have continued to evolve, each generation more powerful than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      From ultraviolet to infrared, from X-rays to gamma rays, space telescopes observe across the electromagnetic spectrum, revealing phenomena invisible to ground-based observatories. The timeline below showcases the most significant space telescopes in chronological order, highlighting their contributions to astronomy and our understanding of the cosmos.

          <p>
            Launched in 1968, the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 (OAO-2) was one of the first successful space telescopes. It observed ultraviolet light from stars and galaxies that cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere. OAO-2 measured the UV spectra of hundreds of stars, planets, and galaxies, operating until 1973 and paving the way for future UV space telescopes.

        <p>
          The Einstein Observatory, also known as HEAO-2 (High Energy Astronomy Observatory 2), was the first fully imaging X-ray telescope in space. Launched in 1978, it discovered X-ray emissions from quasars and provided the first X-ray images of supernova remnants, allowing scientists to study the aftermath of stellar explosions. The telescope operated until 1981 and was a significant advancement in X-ray astronomy.

          The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), launched in 1983, was the first space telescope to perform a survey of the entire sky in infrared light. During its 10-month mission, IRAS discovered six comets, several asteroid families, and provided our first clear views of the core of the Milky Way Galaxy. It also identified nearly 350,000 infrared sources and detected dust disks around stars, suggesting the presence of planetary systems.

          <p>
            The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, has become one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built. After an initial spherical aberration was corrected by astronauts in 1993, Hubble began capturing incredibly detailed images of deep space objects. It has helped determine the age of the universe, identified black holes at the centers of galaxies, and observed the atmospheres of exoplanets. With over 1.5 million observations and counting, Hubble continues to provide valuable data after more than three decades in operation.

          <p>
            The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), launched in 1991, was dedicated to observing the highest-energy form of electromagnetic radiation. It discovered over 400 gamma-ray sources, doubling the number previously known. CGRO provided the first comprehensive survey of the universe in gamma rays, detected mysterious gamma-ray bursts, and identified blazars—supermassive black holes that emit jets of particles traveling at nearly the speed of light directly toward Earth.

        <p>
          The Chandra X-ray Observatory, launched in 1999, is one of NASA's Great Observatories. It focuses on capturing X-rays from high-energy regions of the universe, such as the remnants of exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and matter around black holes. Chandra's unprecedented resolution has allowed astronomers to study the distribution of dark matter, observe X-ray jets from black holes, and investigate the nature of dark energy. Its elliptical orbit takes it a third of the way to the moon, allowing for long, uninterrupted observations.

        <p>
          The Spitzer Space Telescope, launched in 2003, was designed to detect infrared radiation, allowing it to see through cosmic dust clouds to observe star formation, distant galaxies, and planetary systems. Spitzer discovered a ring around Saturn much larger than its visible rings, identified organic molecules in distant galaxies, and observed some of the most distant galaxies ever seen. Its cryogenic cooling system, which kept its instruments at just a few degrees above absolute zero, was depleted in 2009, but the telescope continued "warm" operations until 2020.

        <p>
          The Kepler Space Telescope, launched in 2009, was designed to search for exoplanets—planets orbiting stars other than our Sun. During its mission, Kepler discovered over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets by observing the tiny dips in starlight that occur when planets pass in front of their host stars. Kepler's findings transformed our understanding of planetary systems, revealing that planets are common throughout the galaxy and come in a wide variety of sizes and orbital configurations. The mission ended in 2018 when the spacecraft ran out of fuel.

        <p>
          The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in 2018, is surveying the brightest stars near Earth for exoplanets. Unlike Kepler, which focused on a single patch of sky, TESS is conducting a near all-sky survey, examining stars across 85% of the sky. TESS has already discovered thousands of exoplanet candidates, including potentially habitable worlds. Its primary mission is to identify promising targets for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.

        <p>
          The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in 2021, is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built. With a 6.5-meter primary mirror—over 2.5 times larger than Hubble's—JWST primarily observes in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to see through cosmic dust clouds and study the earliest galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. Positioned 1.5 million kilometers from Earth at the L2 Lagrange point, JWST is revolutionizing our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres, star formation, and the early universe. Its innovative design includes a tennis court-sized sunshield that keeps its instruments at extremely cold temperatures required for infrared observations.

          <h2>Future Telescopes</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The next generation of space telescopes is already in development. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST) will have a field of view 100 times greater than Hubble's, allowing it to conduct large-scale surveys of the universe. The Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) are concepts for future telescopes that could directly image Earth-like exoplanets and search for signs of life. These ambitious missions will build upon the discoveries of their predecessors and continue to expand our understanding of the cosmos.
